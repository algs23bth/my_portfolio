About page
==========================

The source for this page is in `content/about/index.md`.

I have used SASS for the styling of this website. Through SASS I can use operators, variables, inheritance, mixins and nested rules. Those techniques were especially helpful for creating my own button styles. This website utilizes Pico CMS. It is efficient because you can have the theme files in one folder and the content files in another. The website is responsive but I am not using any particular techniques to keep it responsive. I imported fonts from Google Fonts (hosted locally) to use for the theme. I used lint to look for style errors for the SASS, but I kept one error regarding nesting depth (the selector for the nav) because I saw no better way to solve the problem. I also kept the error regarding "adjust-hue" as it worked well originally and the correction didn't work.
